# Using Forms

1. State Management: Each input's state
   is stored in the component's state.
2. Handling Changes: Use onChange to
   detect input changes.
3. Submission: Utilize onSubmit for form
   submissions and prevent default with
   event.preventDefault().
4. Validation: Implement custom
   validation or use third-party libraries.
