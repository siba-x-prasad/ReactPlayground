# CSS Module

- CSS Modules enable us to use the same class name without conflicting in multiple files since each class name is assigned a distinct programmatic name.
- For large projects, React CSS Modules offer several advantages, including modularity, reusability, maintainability, scalability, and increased teamwork.

- Problem with general css files
  - If we will define a style in one and the classnames can be duplicated.
  - In that case, if one will change in one class name, it will impact all over the other similar className as well
- To avoid this, CSS module comes to existance.

```
Cat.css
.meow {
  color: orange
}
```

- Above codebase will be converted to some unique name named cat_meow_j3xk

```
.cat_meow_j3xk {
  color: orange
}
```

- Localized class names to avoid global conflicts.
- Styles are scoped to individual components
- Helps in creating component-specific styles.
- Automatically generates unique class names.
- Promotes modular and maintainable CSS.
- Can use alongside global css when needed.

# Rules

- Lets consider a component named **FoodItem.JSX**
- Create the css file for the above files like this at the same directory label.
- **FoodItem.module.css**

## Details

```
.sp-item {
  background-color: khaki;
}

.spSpan {
  font-weight: 500;
  color: red;
}

.nav {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

- How to define in our class

```
import styles from "./foodItem.module.css";

const FoodItem = (props) => {
  console.log(styles);
  return (
    <> <li key={props.name}  className={`${styles['sp-item']} list-group-item`}>
    <span className={styles.spSpan}>{props.name}</span>
    </li>
    </>
  );
}

export default FoodItem;
```
