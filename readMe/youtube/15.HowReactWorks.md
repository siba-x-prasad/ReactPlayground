# How React Works

## Root Component.

- The App is the main or root component of a react application.
- It's the starting point of your React COmponent tree.

## Virtual DOM:

- React Creates an in-memory structure called the virtual DOM.
- Different from the actual browser DOM.
- It's a lightweight representation where each node stands for a component and it's attributes.

## Reconciliation Process:

- When component data changes, React updates the virtual DOM's state to mirror these changes.
- React then compares the current and previous verion of the Virtual DOM.
- It defines the specific nodes that need updating.
- Only these nodes are updatd in the real browser DOM, making it effecient.

## React and ReactDOM:

- The actual updating of the browser's DOM is not done by React itself.
- It's handled by a companion library called react-dom.

## Root Element:

- The root div acts as a container for the React App.
- The scrict tag is where the react app starts executing.
- If you check main.jsx, the component tree is rendered inside this root element.

## Strict Mode Component:

- It's a special component in react.
- Doesnot have a visual representation.
- It's purpose is to spot potential issues in your React App.

## Platform Independent :

- React's design allows it to be platform-agnostic.
- WHile react-dom helps build Web UI's using React, ReactNative can be used to craft mobile app Ui's


# React Vs Angular Vs Vue
## React, Angular, and Vue:
- React is a library, while Angular and Vue.js are frameworks.
- React focuses on U; Angular and Vue.js offer comprehensive tools for full app development.
## Library vs. Framework:
- A library offers specific functionality.
- A framework provides a set of tools and guidelines.
- In simpler terms: React is a tool; Angular and Vue.js are toolsets.
## React's Specialty:
- React's main role is crafting dynamic, interactive Uls.
- It doesn't handle routing, HTTP calls, state management, and
more.
## React's Flexibility:
- React doesn't dictate tool choices for other app aspects.
- Developers pick what fits their project best.
## About Angular and Vue.js:
- Angular, developed by Google, provides a robust framework with
a steep learning curve.
- Vue.js is known for its simplicity and ease of integration, making
it beginner-friendly.
