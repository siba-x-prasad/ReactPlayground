# Redux

1. State management for cross component or app-wide state.
2. Redux is a predictable state management library for JavaScript apps.
3. Local State vs Cross-component state vs App-Wide state
4. useState or useReducer vs useState with prop drilling vs useState or
   useContext or Redux

- Install the package

```
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

## React Context Vs Redux

1. You can use both.
2. Setup and Coding is tough especially if you have multiple contextproviders.
3. Performance is slow. Context should only be used for things that rarely change. On the other hand Redux has great performance.
4. If these things don't matter to you then you can choose not to use redux and stay with React-Context.

## How Redux Works

1. Single Source: Uses a single central store to maintain the entire application's state.
2. Actions: Components never directly change the store. Changes to state are made through
   dispatched actions, which describe events.
3. Reducers: Actions are processed by reducers, pure functions that return the new state.
4. Immutable: State is immutable; every change results in a new state object.
5. This is different from useReducer hook.

## Working With Redux

1. `npm init -y`
2. `npm install redux`
3. `const redux = require ('redux');`
4. We need to setup all 4 basic things:
5. Reducer
6. Store
7. Subscriber
8. Actions
9. Node redux-demo.js command to run node server

## REACT WITH REDUX

1. `npm install redux`
2. `npm install react-redux`
3. Create store folder with **Index.js** file
4. Creating the store using

```
  import {createStore} from redux.
```

5. Providing the store with react
1. Provider from react-redux

```
  <Provider store={store}><App /></Provider>
```

6. Using the store
1. useSelector hook gets a slice of the store.

```
Const counter = useSelector(state => state.counter);
```

2. Subscription is already setup and only will re-execute when only your slice is changed. Subscription is
   automatically cleared also.
3. Dispatch Actions using the useDispatch hook.
