# CUstom Hook

1. Reusable Logic: Custom hooks allow you to
   extract and reuse component logic across multiple
   components.
2. Naming Convention: Typically start with "use"
   (e.g., useWindowSize, useFetch),
3. Combining Hooks: Custom hooks can combine
   multiple built-in hooks like useState, useEffect,
   and others.
4. Sharing State: Enables sharing of stateful logic
   without changing component hierarchy.
5. Isolation: Helps in isolating complex logic, making
   components cleaner and easier to maintain.
6. Custom Return Values: Can return any value
   (arrays, objects, or any other data type) based on
   requirements.

- Example

```
const[value, toggle] = useToggle(true);

const [value, {on, off, toggle}] = useBoolean(true);
```
