# Use Reducer

1. **useReducer** is a hook in React that offers more control over
   state operations compared to useState, especially for
   complex state logic.
2. **Components:** It involves two main components:
   • **Reducer:** A pure function that takes the current state and
   an action and returns a new state.
   • **Action:** An object describing what happened, typically
   having a type property.
3. **Initialization:** It's invoked as
   const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState).
4. **Dispatch:** Actions are dispatched using the dispatch
   function, which invokes the reducer with the current state
   and the given action.
5. **Use Cases:** Particularly useful for managing state in large
   components or when the next state depends on the
   previous one.
6. **Predictable State Management:** Due to its strict structure, it
   leads to more predictable and maintainable state management.
