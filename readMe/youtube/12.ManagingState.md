# Managing State

- **State** represents data that changes over time.
- **State** is local and provide to the component.
- **State** changes cause the component to re-render.
- **For** functional component, use the useState hook.
- **React** functions that start with word use are called hooks
- **Hooks** should only be used inside components.
- **Parent** Components can pass state down to children via props
- **Lifting State up** share state between components by moving it to their closest common ancestor.

## useState

```
  import { useState } from "react";
```

- **const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);**

- count is used for getter and setCount is used as setter.

```
setCount(123);
```

## State Vs Props

## State

- Local and mutable data within a component.
- Initialized within the component.
- Can change over time.
- Causes re-render when updated.
- Managed using useState in functional components.

## Props

- Passed into a component from it's parent.
- Read-only (immutable) within the receiving component.
- Allow parent-to-child component communication.
- Changes in props can also cause a re-render.
