# React Router

1. Installation: Use pm install react-router-dom.
2. We are going to use the latest version which is 6+
3. RouterProvider: Wraps the app for routing
   capabilities.
4. createBrowserRouter: helps creating the mapping
   for router provider.
5. Declarative Routing: Easily define application
   routes.
6. Routes are React components.

```
npm install react-router-dom
```

- Here is the code

```
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App.jsx";
import "./index.css";
import { RouterProvider, createBrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./components/Home.jsx";
import Blogs from "./components/Blogs.jsx";
import About from "./components/ABout.jsx";

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  { path: "/", element: <App /> },
  { path: "/home", element: <Home /> },
  { path: "/blogs", element: <Blogs /> },
  { path: "/about", element: <About /> }
]);

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RouterProvider router={router} />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

- In above, case, it will replace whole page without the header footer and sidebar.

## Layout Route

## Route Links

```
import {useNavigate} from 'react-router-dom';
const Component = () => {
  // triggers re-render on every path change
  const navigate = useNavigate();
}
```

- **Link** Component with **to** property can be used to avoid reloading.
- **useNavigate** hook can be used to do navigation programmatically.
