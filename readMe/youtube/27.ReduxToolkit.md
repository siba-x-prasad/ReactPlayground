# Redux Toolkit

## Why to use Redux Toolkit

- Action TYpes are difficult to maintain.
- Store becoming too big.
- Mistakenly editing store.
- Reducer becoming too big.

## Working with Redux Toolkit

1. ``npm install @reduxjs/toolkit`
2. Remove redux from package.json
3.

```
Import {createSlice} from "@reduxjs/toolkit"
```

4. Slices of the store can be created using the following syntax:

```
const slice = createSlice({
name: ''
initialState: {},
reducers: {
smallReducerMethods: (state, action) => {

  },
}
})
```

5. ConfigureStore combines multiple reducers and can be used as:

```
configureStore({
  reducer: {name: slice.reducer}
  }
)
```

6.

```
  export actions = slice.actions;
```

7. Actions can be dispatched like: actions.reducerMethod (payload);
