# Context API

1. **Prop Drilling:** Context API addresses prop drilling;
   component composition is an alternative.
   - Passing props in multiple components and finally retrieving it at app level.
   - Context api is nothing but shared storage.
2. **Folder Setup:** Use a store folder for context files.
3. **Initialization:** Use React.createContext with initial state
   and export it.
4. **Provider:** Implement with contextName.Provider in
   components.
5. **Access Value:** Use the useContext hook.
6. **Dynamic Data:** Combine context value with state.
7. **Export Functions:** Context can also export functions for
   actions
8. **Logic Separation:** This helps keep the Ul and business
   logic separate from each other.
