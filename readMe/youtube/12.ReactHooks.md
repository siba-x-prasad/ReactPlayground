# React Hooks

- Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.

- Although Hooks generally replace class components, there are no plans to remove classes from React

## Hook Rules

- There are 3 rules for hooks:
- Hooks can only be called inside React function components.
- Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.
- Hooks cannot be conditional

## useState

- The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component.
- State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application.

```
import { useState } from "react";
const [color, setColor] = useState(""); // "" is the default value
```

- color is used as getColor and to set use setColor('color');

## useRef

- The useRef Hook allows you to persist values between renders.
- It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated.
- It can be used to access a DOM element directly.

```
import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from "react";
function App() {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("");
  const count = useRef(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    count.current = count.current + 1;
  });

  return (
    <>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={inputValue}
        onChange={(e) => setInputValue(e.target.value)}
      />
      <h1>Render Count: {count.current}</h1>
    </>
  );
}
```

## useEffect
- The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components.
- Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.
- useEffect accepts two arguments. The second argument is optional.
- useEffect(<function>, <dependency>)
1. No dependency passed:
```
useEffect(() => {
  //Runs on every render
});
```
2. An empty array:
```
useEffect(() => {
  //Runs only on the first render
}, []);
```
3. Props or state values:
```
useEffect(() => {
  //Runs on the first render
  //And any time any dependency value changes
}, [prop, state]);
```
## useContext
- https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_usecontext.asp
- React Context is a way to manage state globally.
- It can be used together with the useState Hook to share state between deeply nested components more easily than with useState alone.
```
import { useState, createContext } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

const UserContext = createContext()

function Component1() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState("Jesse Hall");

  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>
      <h1>{`Hello ${user}!`}</h1>
      <Component2 user={user} />
    </UserContext.Provider>
  );
}
```
## useReducer

## useCalback

## useMemo
- useMemo is a React Hook that lets you cache the result of a calculation between re-renders.
```
  import { useMemo } from 'react';
  function TodoList({ todos, tab }) {
    const visibleTodos = useMemo(
      () => filterTodos(todos, tab),
      [todos, tab]
    );
  }
```
## custom Hooks
